          <h3>Pricing </h3>
          <p>The tariff rates provided on the Website are non-negotiable and may be subject to change without prior notice. The inclusion or exclusion of applicable taxes for the Properties is contingent upon the specific type of Property. The mentioned tariffs may be susceptible to inaccuracies due to technical glitches. In the event of such errors, which are beyond our control, we reserve the right to rectify the mistake. After correction, the incorrect and erroneous tariff will not be enforceable. </p>
          <h3>Rights to bookings and property possession </h3>
          <p>In case of any Booking, it is explicitly understood and acknowledged by all the Guests that they do not and will not, get the possession, charge or claim to possess any of the booked properties at any time. Guests are prohibited from checking into the Property before or at the time of Check-In unless they comply with specified requirements. Failure to comply with these prescribed requirements will render Guests ineligible for any refund of the Booking Amount or Deposit and no compensation of any kind shall be claimable by Guests or payable by So Many Mornings.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Guests must provide Booking Confirmation issued by So Many Mornings along with the proof/details of full payments</li>
            <li>In adherence to the government security regulations, every Guest must mandatorily provide original government-issued photo IDs for verification along with a copy of the photo IDs, on or before check-in.</li>
            <li>If any guest provides incorrect and false information during Booking, we reserve the right to cancel the booking, deny entry to the Property and if the Guests have already checked-In, evict them from the Property. In such circumstances, the Deposits and Booking Amount paid by the Guests shall not be refunded and no compensation shall be paid by So Many Mornings.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>During check-in or throughout the stay, the total number of Guests or visitors of the Guests shall not exceed the number mentioned at the time of Booking. So Many Mornings, at its sole discretion, may permit additional persons to stay at the Property for an extra cost.</p>
          <h3>Promotional offers </h3>
          <p>By providing your contact details on the website, you consent to receive promotional content from So Many Mornings through WhatsApp, email, push notifications, and SMS. So Many Mornings may periodically offer you various discounts, offers and promotions. The terms and conditions for discounts, offers, or promotional schemes will be clearly outlined on the website and may be subject to change. We reserve the right to modify or terminate any promotional scheme without prior notice.</p>
          <h3>Booking confirmation </h3>
          <p>Guests acknowledge and agree that making advance payments, paying a security deposit or receiving a Booking Confirmation means that guests have unconditionally accepted the booking details. It's important to note that the issuance of a Booking Confirmation does not guarantee the confirmation of the booking itself. So Many Mornings is not obligated to fulfill a booking unless the entire booking amount is paid by the Guest through the designated payment mode, even if a Booking Confirmation has been sent to the Guest. The Booking Confirmation becomes null and void if the full booking amount is not received by us by the specified due dates.</p>
          <h3>Check-in and check-out time </h3>
          <p>Check-in and Check-out times are specified in the relevant Booking Confirmation. We advise Guests to adhere to the check-in time and not arrive at the Property before the stated Check-In time as it would be difficult to accommodate the Guests arriving before Check-In time. Guests agree not to stay at the Property beyond the Check-out time mentioned in the Booking Confirmation. </p>
          <h3>Advance payment </h3>
          <p>Guests are required to make an advance payment before receiving the Booking Confirmation as a security to safeguard So Many Mornings against potential revenue loss due to cancellations or unpaid balances. If the Advance is not received, we will not send the booking confirmation to the Guest.</p>
          <p>Guests must promptly inspect and report any damages to the Property, including equipment, appliances, cutlery, crockery, utensils, furniture, fittings, furnishing, and structure. Failure to report damages will hold the Guests accountable, and they must reimburse us without delay.
During their stay, Guests must use the Property and its contents with utmost care. Upon Check-Out, the Guest is responsible for leaving the Property in good and reasonably clean condition, excluding normal usage. If the repair/replacement cost exceeds the security deposit, Guests will be notified in writing and must settle the excess amount within 7 days. 
</p>
